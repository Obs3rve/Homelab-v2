Phase 1: Setup and Preparation
In this phase, we will prepare the environment and set up the foundational tools and configurations needed to manage the Raspberry Pis and start the journey. This includes setting up SSH access, initial configurations, and testing connectivity between the nodes.

Goals

Establish SSH access to Raspberry Pis.
Assign static IP addresses for better management.
Test connectivity between the Raspberry Pis.

I have documented this step multiple times. Here's a link to older guides
